# T1w-T2w-Ratio-Computation
My work at NIRAL labs, UNC. This project deals with monkey brain MRI, which have to be corrected for biases and scanner artefacts.
First, the T1 and T2 images are registered onto an atlas and a mask, to ensure they are in the same space and to determine the area of interest. Next, Bias Fold Correction is done with an array of different settings such as B Spline distance. Following this, the image is calibrated with eye and muscle masks, before the T1w/T2w ratio is calculated by dividing pairs of T1 and T2 images. Finally, statistical analysis is done to determine the settings resulting in the lowest error.
